# Duo-Project

### Overview

This repository contains the source code for the desktop app as well as the arduino source code for both the RC module and the sensors.

### How it works

The desktop app used to monitor sensor data and train progress. The desktop also acts as the central nervous system that dictates to the train to move or stop depending on whether a sensor has been triggered.
